```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
require(tidyverse)
require(lattice)
```

```{r}
Homers_data <- read.csv(file="Homers_data.csv")
my1000 <- sample(Homers_data$kkardashtemp ,size = 1000, replace=T)
densityplot(my1000,main="original data")

```

The resulting plot shows two peaks, making it bimodal. The peaks have bimodal distribution, meaning that there are two values in the data that have the highest frequencies rather than one. One of the peaks seems to be slighlty shorter than the other one, but for thr most part, they appear to be the same size.
